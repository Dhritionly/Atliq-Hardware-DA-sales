# Atliq Hardware Sales Report   

# 

Atliq Hardware is currently experiencing declining sales and challenges with their sales data utilization. To address these issues, they've brought in a Data Analyst team. As a member of this team, I've undertaken a comprehensive analysis:

Data cleaning and sorting were performed using MySQL to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
An ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process was implemented to prepare the data for analysis.
Finally, an interactive dashboard was created using Power BI to visualize key sales trends and identify underlying problems.
This multi-faceted approach aims to uncover the root causes of the declining market and provide actionable solutions for Atliq Hardware.
